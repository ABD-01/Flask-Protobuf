# Contributing to Flask-Protobuf

Although my project is completed, I beleive this can help others who are working in same line as me.

Most of the work is now using Protobuf serialization instead of JSON. If we could make Flask integrated with Protobuf, it would be great. For example how I created Dynamic form based on protocol buffer definations.
